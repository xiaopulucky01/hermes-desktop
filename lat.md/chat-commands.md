# Slash command execution

Typed slash commands (`/compact`, `/compress`, `/reset`, `/web`, …) are run through the gateway's command pipeline, not submitted to the model as plain prompt text. This is what makes them _do_ something instead of being echoed back as prose.

The desktop talks to the hermes-agent gateway over JSON-RPC. A normal message goes via `prompt.submit`, which the gateway treats as a user turn — so a literal `/compact` reaches the model and comes back as text. Real commands must instead go through `slash.exec` (registry-backed worker) with a `command.dispatch` fallback for commands that resolve to an alias, plugin, skill, or an agent prompt.

## Routing pipeline

The pure routing logic lives in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/slashExec.ts#executeSlash]]: try `slash.exec`, and on rejection fall back to `command.dispatch`, returning a `SlashExecOutcome` of `done` (output rendered), `send` (resolved to an agent prompt the caller should stream), or `error`.

It mirrors hermes-agent's reference client (`web/src/lib/slashExec.ts`) so every front-end implements the same contract. Returning the `send` directive rather than dispatching it keeps the streaming turn lifecycle (loading state, active turn, `prompt.submit`) in the caller.

## Local vs gateway commands

Every typed slash command is resolved through the merged catalog before execution. Ownership is explicit (`target: "desktop" | "agent" | "model"`); display categories such as `info` do not determine routing.

Desktop-only commands delegate to local renderer handlers, Agent commands use the gateway command pipeline, and model commands build a prompt through the shared model-submission formatter. The legacy transport reports Agent commands as unavailable instead of sending raw `/…` text to the model.

## Commands never queue

Slash commands run on the gateway's **persistent slash-worker subprocess**, concurrent with any in-flight turn — so they respond instantly and must NOT sit in the busy queue behind a running turn (only plain prompts queue).

`handleSubmitOrQueue` in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/Chat.tsx]] dispatches every `/…` input immediately to the central router. Desktop and slash-worker commands can complete concurrently; model commands and Agent `send`/skill directives are formatted once and queued when the main model turn is busy.

Because no global loading state is set, the slash branch shows its own feedback: it inserts an in-place `⏳ Running …` agent bubble, buffers the pipeline output, and replaces that bubble with the result (or `error: …`) when the command resolves — otherwise a slow or unreachable gateway would leave the user staring at nothing.

## Transport connection lifecycle

Every dashboard turn first connects a JSON-RPC WebSocket to the gateway; that handshake must be time-bounded or a stalled socket wedges the whole transport with no error and no fallback (issue #718).

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/dashboardGatewayClient.ts#DashboardGatewayClient#connect]] resolves on `open`, rejects on `error` or an early `close`, **and** rejects on a connect-timeout (default 10s). A WebSocket stuck in `CONNECTING` — TCP accepted but the upgrade never completing, e.g. when a busy renderer starves the handshake — fires none of those events on its own, so without the timer the connect promise never settles. When it never settles, `ensureClient` in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useDashboardChatTransport.ts#useDashboardChatTransport]] never resolves, its cached `connectingRef` promise poisons every later send, `setIsLoading(false)` never runs, and the user sees a permanent loading spinner. The timeout makes the promise reject so auto mode falls back to the legacy HTTP transport (and explicit-dashboard mode surfaces a real error) instead of hanging. Per-request calls are separately bounded by their own 30s timeout.

## Completion text reconciliation

On `message.complete` the desktop reconciles the text streamed via `message.delta` with the turn's `final_response`, because a last-turn-only final would otherwise clobber text streamed before a tool call (#746).

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/dashboardEventAdapter.ts#completeAssistantWithFinalText]] rewrites the last assistant bubble through [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/dashboardEventAdapter.ts#mergeStreamedWithFinal]], which compares whitespace-insensitively and: uses the final text when it already contains the streamed text; keeps the streamed text when it contains the final (preserving pre-tool-call content); stitches a re-streamed boundary by dropping the duplicated word-aligned seam (rejecting coincidental mid-word overlaps); replaces a garbled re-stream with the final text when the two converge on a substantial common suffix (a corrupted-prefix delta — e.g. a mangled CJK stream — that ends the same sentence as the clean final, rather than the disjoint pre-tool-call + answer pair); and otherwise concatenates the two with a blank-line separator so segments never run together. On the remote/SSH path deltas are not rendered (`renderAssistantDeltas: false`), so the bubble starts empty and the final text is used verbatim.

## Reasoning & tool activity rows

Streamed reasoning and tool calls are folded into compact, collapsible transcript rows rather than stacked bubbles, so a turn with heavy thinking or many tool calls stays scannable.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/HistoryRow.tsx#ReasoningRow]] renders the `Thought` / `Thinking…` row and [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/HistoryRow.tsx#ToolActivityGroup]] folds a contiguous run of tool calls/results into one row titled by [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/HistoryRow.tsx#toolActivityGroupTitle]]. Each row is collapsed by default and borderless (Codex-style): dim at rest, it brightens and reveals an expand chevron beside the title on hover/focus, and clicking toggles the body open. While the turn is still streaming the leading icon is a `Grid` loader (purple for reasoning, blue for tools); once finished it shows the brain/tool glyph.

## Bubble hover timestamp

Each user/assistant bubble reveals a relative "time ago" label on row hover, so the transcript stays uncluttered at rest but is still scrutable when a user wants to know _when_ something was said.

The canonical time comes from state.db: [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/sessionHistory.ts#dbItemsToChatMessages]] copies each row's `timestamp` onto the `ChatBubbleMessage`, and [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/sessionHistory.ts#reconcileAfterDbRefresh|the end-of-stream reconcile]] adopts it onto the matching streamed bubble (via `mergeDbMetadataIntoStreamed`) so a live turn picks up its real time after refresh without remounting. state.db stores times in **seconds**, so `toEpochMs` in MessageRow scales any sub-`1e12` value up to milliseconds before use (otherwise it renders as ~Jan 1970). [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/MessageRow.tsx#formatBubbleTime]] builds the label with date-fns `formatDistanceToNowStrict` (e.g. "5 minutes ago", "just now" under 10s), with `formatBubbleTimeAbsolute` supplying the exact date/time as the `<time>` element's `title`/`dateTime`. The `.chat-message:hover .chat-bubble-time` CSS fades it in below the bubble, anchored to `.chat-message` because `.chat-bubble`'s own `overflow` would clip it.

## Renderer-native commands

A few non-local commands have dedicated desktop handling and must NOT be diverted to the gateway slash pipeline, or they'd lose their behaviour.

The approval responses `/approve` and `/deny` (the `RENDERER_NATIVE_SLASH` set) are excluded from the pipeline and sent as prompt-level input, matching their dedicated button handlers — `slash.exec` rejects pending-input commands anyway.

## Side questions (`/btw`)

`/btw` (with aliases `/bg` and `/background`) is a side question that runs on a **concurrent background agent**, so it must never block or queue behind the main turn — that is the point of "ask without affecting context".

It maps to the gateway's `prompt.background` RPC, which spawns a separate agent and reports back later via a `background.complete` event (a normal `prompt.submit` mid-turn is rejected with "session busy"). [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useChatActions.ts#parseBackgroundCommand|parseBackgroundCommand]] detects these commands; `handleSubmitOrQueue` in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/Chat.tsx]] fires them immediately — bypassing the busy queue — via the shared background flow (also used by the 💭 quick-ask button). The transport's `runBackground` ([[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useDashboardChatTransport.ts#useDashboardChatTransport]]) calls the RPC, and its gateway-event handler renders the `background.complete` answer as a standalone `[bg …]` message. The legacy (non-dashboard) transport has no background RPC and falls back to the blocking quick-ask.

## Central command router

The central slash command architecture in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/slash/handleSlashCommand.ts#handleSlashCommand]] classifies every slash command into a discriminated union (`target: "desktop" | "agent" | "model"`). Unrecognized commands return an error instead of reaching the model as prose.

The command palette and executor share a catalog built by [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/slash/commandCatalog.ts#createSlashCatalog]]. Hermes Agent metadata comes from `commands.catalog`; Desktop commands are merged after collision validation, and upstream names/aliases are normalized from `/name` to the router's canonical `name`.

### Desktop commands

Desktop commands in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/slash/desktopCommands.ts#DESKTOP_SLASH_COMMANDS]] handle local Electron/renderer UI operations such as opening settings, triggering the active chat's model picker, and switching navigation views without sending prompts.

### Agent commands

Agent commands forward upstream via [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/slash/executeAgentCommand.ts#executeAgentCommand]] using gateway JSON-RPC.

### Model commands

Model commands and Agent `send`/skill directives pass through [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/slash/prepareModelSubmission.ts#prepareModelSubmission]] before entering the standard chat transport. This is the only slash route allowed to submit model content.

### Command icons

Visual presentation in the autocomplete popup is handled by [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/slash/SlashCommandIcon.tsx#SlashCommandIcon]], mapping command names to Lucide icons with fallback defaults and a custom SVG registry.
