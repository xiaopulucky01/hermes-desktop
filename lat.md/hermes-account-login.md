# Hermes One account login

Signs the desktop app into a Hermes One account (on `hermes-one-backend`),
distinct from the per-provider model OAuth in [[provider-setup]].

It uses the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628): the app shows a
code, opens the browser to approve it, and polls for a token — so it can then act
on the user's behalf.

The backend serves the grant (see the backend's `lat.md/device-login.md`); this
document covers the desktop half — the client, secure storage, IPC, and UI.
The stored token's first consumer is [[agent-sync|cloud agent sync]].

## Device login client

[[src/main/hermes-account.ts#startDeviceLogin]] runs the whole flow for a profile.

It POSTs `/api/device/code` (sending the machine hostname as `device_name`, which
the approval page shows), hands the code to the caller (`onCode`) so the browser
can open and the modal can show it, then polls `/api/device/token` until the grant
resolves. [[src/main/hermes-account.ts#cancelDeviceLogin]] stops an abandoned flow
(single-flight, mirroring [[src/main/hermes-auth.ts#runHermesAuthLogin]]).

The backend base URL is resolved fresh on every call by
[[src/main/hermes-account.ts#getApiUrl]], **runtime env first** so switching
backends is an env edit + relaunch (no rebuild): `HERMES_API_URL` (explicit
override) → `MAIN_VITE_HERMES_API_URL` from `process.env` → the build-time
baked `import.meta.env.MAIN_VITE_HERMES_API_URL` → `http://localhost:3002`.
Because Vite inlines `import.meta.env` at *build* time, the `process.env` reads
are what make it truly env-driven in dev — [[src/main/load-env.ts#loadDotEnvForDev]]
copies the project `.env` into `process.env` at startup (dev only; called from
[[src/main/index.ts]]), and packaged/CI builds carry the value baked in by the
release workflow. The resolved value is normalized by
[[src/main/api-url.ts#normalizeApiUrl]] — a remote `http://` origin is upgraded
to `https://` (localhost stays http), because remote backends 301-redirect
http→https and Node's fetch drops the `Authorization` header across that
scheme-change redirect, so authenticated sync calls would 401 while anonymous
device login still succeeds. [[src/main/account-store.ts#getAccount]] applies
the same normalization when reading the `apiUrl` persisted in `account.json`, so
a URL stored as http by an earlier login is corrected on read (the sync path
uses that stored value) without a re-login. An optional client key
([[src/main/hermes-account.ts#getApiKey]], same order with
`MAIN_VITE_HERMES_API_KEY` / `HERMES_API_KEY`) is sent as `x-api-key` via
[[src/main/hermes-account.ts#apiHeaders]] on all backend calls (device login
and [[agent-sync|agent sync]]); the backend doesn't require it yet, and a key
shipped in a desktop binary is extractable — abuse-limiting, not a secret.

Each poll response is turned into the next action by the pure
[[src/main/hermes-account.ts#interpretTokenResponse]]: `pending` keeps polling,
`slow_down` backs off, `access_denied`/`expired_token` are terminal, and a token
ends the loop. Keeping it pure makes the RFC branch logic unit-testable without a
live server.

## Account store

[[src/main/account-store.ts#saveAccount]] persists the redeemed session to
`account.json` under the profile home, encrypting the bearer token at rest with
the OS keychain via Electron `safeStorage` — the same approach as
[[wallet-token-balances#Wallet Store]].

The token never leaves the main process: [[src/main/account-store.ts#getAccount]]
returns only the public profile (`apiUrl` + user), while
[[src/main/account-store.ts#getAccessToken]] decrypts the token for authenticated
backend calls, and [[src/main/account-store.ts#clearAccount]] signs out.

Because the file lives under whichever profile was active at sign-in, app-wide
consumers locate it with [[src/main/account-store.ts#findAccountProfile]]
(default home first, then named profiles) — see [[agent-sync#Sync engine]].

## IPC and UI

The main process exposes `hermes-account-login` (+ `-cancel`, `-get`, `-logout`)
in [[src/main/ipc/register.ts#registerIpcHandlers]].

The login handler opens the browser to the approval page and streams
progress/code events to the renderer. The preload bridge surfaces these as
`accountLogin`, `getAccount`, etc. on `window.hermesAPI` ([[src/preload/index.ts]]),
typed with the shared shapes in [[src/shared/account.ts]].

The account is device-wide, so the `-get` handler resolves it through
[[src/main/account-store.ts#findAccountProfile]] rather than the active
profile — switching agents must not read as signed out just because
`account.json` lives under the profile that was active at sign-in. Likewise
`-logout` calls [[src/main/account-store.ts#clearAllAccounts]], which sweeps
every profile home holding an account file (two sign-ins on different
profiles leave two), so signing out signs the whole device out.

In the renderer, [[src/renderer/src/components/HermesAccountModal.tsx]] shows the
`user_code` to confirm and reports the result, and
[[src/renderer/src/screens/Providers/Providers.tsx]] hosts the "Hermes One
account" card that opens it; once signed in it renders an identity card —
avatar (or letter fallback), name/email, a "Connected" status line — with a
Sign out action.

## Tests

Unit tests cover the two pieces that can break silently.

[[src/main/account-store.test.ts]] round-trips the encrypted token, asserts the
public shape never leaks it, and checks logout and the "secure storage
unavailable" guard. [[src/main/hermes-account.test.ts]] exercises
[[src/main/hermes-account.ts#interpretTokenResponse]] across every RFC branch,
the base-URL resolution order (runtime env → baked build-time value →
localhost default), and the conditional `x-api-key` header.

### Signs out everywhere

With accounts saved under both the default home and a named profile,
`clearAllAccounts` removes every one — afterwards `findAccountProfile` is null
and both profiles read as signed out.
